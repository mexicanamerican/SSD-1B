## Model Description

The Segmind Stable Diffusion Model (SSD-1B) is a distilled **50% smaller version** of the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), offering a **60% speedup** while maintaining high-quality text-to-image generation capabilities. It has been trained on diverse datasets, including Grit and Midjourney scrape data, to enhance its ability to create a wide range of visual content based on textual prompts.

This model employs a knowledge distillation strategy, where it leverages the teachings of several expert models in succession, including SDXL, ZavyChromaXL, and JuggernautXL, to combine their strengths and produce impressive visual outputs.

Special thanks to the HF team ðŸ¤— especially [Sayak](https://huggingface.co/sayakpaul), [Patrick](https://github.com/patrickvonplaten) and [Poli](https://huggingface.co/multimodalart) for their collaboration and guidance on this work.

## Usage:
This model can be used via the ðŸ§¨ Diffusers library. 

Make sure to install diffusers from source by running
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

In addition, please install `transformers`, `safetensors` and `accelerate`:
```
pip install transformers accelerate safetensors
```

To use the model, you can run the following:

```py
from diffusers import StableDiffusionXLPipeline
import torch
pipe = StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained("segmind/SSD-1B", torch_dtype=torch.float16, use_safetensors=True, variant="fp16")
pipe.to("cuda")
# if using torch < 2.0
# pipe.enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention()
prompt = "An astronaut riding a green horse" # Your prompt here
neg_prompt = "ugly, blurry, poor quality" # Negative prompt here
image = pipe(prompt=prompt, negative_prompt=neg_prompt).images[0]
```

### Please do use negative prompting for the best quality!

### Out-of-Scope Use

The SSD-1B Model is not suitable for creating factual or accurate representations of people, events, or real-world information. It is not intended for tasks requiring high precision and accuracy.

## Limitations and Bias

Limitations & Bias
The SSD-1B Model has some challenges in embodying absolute photorealism, especially in human depictions. While it grapples with incorporating clear text and maintaining the fidelity of complex compositions due to its autoencoding approach, these hurdles pave the way for future enhancements. Importantly, the model's exposure to a diverse dataset, though not a panacea for ingrained societal and digital biases, represents a foundational step towards more equitable technology. Users are encouraged to interact with this pioneering tool with an understanding of its current limitations, fostering an environment of conscious engagement and anticipation for its continued evolution.
